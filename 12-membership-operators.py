# Pythonâ€™s membership operators test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples.
# There are two membership operators as explained below- 
# in     => Evaluates to true, if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise. 
# not in => Evaluates to true, if it does not find a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.
